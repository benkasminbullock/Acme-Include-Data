=head1 NAME

Acme::Include::Data - how to include data files with a CPAN module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a demonstration module which exists for the purpose of
examining its source code rather than for use.

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a demonstration module which demonstrates how to include a
data file with a Perl module and how to read it in at run time.

If you are a CPAN author or use the CPAN-style tools to distribute
your data, you may have wondered how to include data with your Perl
distribution.

Any file under lib in the distribution is bundled into the
distribution by F<Makefile.PL>. So if your distribution is called
F<Acme::Include::Data>, then a file called
F<lib/Acme/Include/this-is-a-data-file.txt> is automatically included
into the distribution.

To read the data file in, simply use __FILE__: 

[% example("read-data") %]

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 yes_it_works

This is a function for testing the module.
